# Go Worker Pattern

## Description
Golang worker used for process heavy activities. 
This is strongly based off of the article [here](http://marcio.io/2015/07/handling-1-million-requests-per-minute-with-golang/)
by Marcio Castilho over at Malwarebytes. I recommend reading
the article to understand the inner mechanics of the worker pattern 
used here. With that, this project sets out to "finish off" the
pattern that was outlined in the article in a reusable and manageble way
, provide some working examples for usage, and give a few strategies for testing.

## Usage

## Testing
#### Methodology 

#### Testing a singular job

#### Testing the logic around the job
